## Introduction
The 3D_design_robot_leg project is a 3D model designed to showcase the integration of eight motors to achieve complex movements. The model was created using Tinkercad and is intended for educational and experimental purposes.

## Features
- **3D Model**: Designed using Tinkercad.
- **Eight Motors**: The model uses eight different motors to perform various movements.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to assemble and modify for different experiments.

## Requirements
- 3D Printer
- Tinkercad account (for modifications)
- Motor controller board
- Power supply
- [STL File](./path-to-your-STL-file)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D_design_robot_leg.git

Print the 3D model using a 3D printer.
Assemble the parts as shown in the image provided.

## Usage
Connect the motors to the motor controller board.
Power the motors using the appropriate power supply.
Control the movements using your preferred programming language or software.
